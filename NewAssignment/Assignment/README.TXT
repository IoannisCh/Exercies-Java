PROJECT TITLE: Observation Logging systen
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Help our local astronomy club
VERSION : 1.4
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Right clicking on the TestListString class
AUTHOR: Ioannis
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Start using this application by right click on the 
TestListString class and chose the method Lists populateList. This will 
generate an object, by default named list1:Lists when we run the program
for the first time. If we run again, this will increase and we will get list2:Lists
and so on.
Now with our main object created we can start viewing our methods.We can also start
creating objects from other classes. For example we can create an object called asteroid1
from our asteroids class. Completing the necessary fields, with our objervation, we can 
then insert this object in our list, for example lists1:Lists and have a new entry in
our list, the latest discovery in the night sky.
